# MMOD

(Note: this is a WIP!)

MMOD stands for micrometeroids and orbital debris. There are over 30,000 large (size greater than 10cm) and more than 1 million smaller MMODs in low earth orbit (LEO), or the region of space below 2,000 km.

Ptolemy protocol is a proposed method of decentralized incentivization toward the global effort of observing, identifying, and recording the locations of these objects.

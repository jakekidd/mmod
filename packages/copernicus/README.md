# Copernicus

A network node for an optimistic, application-specific, functionally-minimal layer 2 partial rollup optimized for data submission, storage and representation for a global registry cataloging and classifying LEO orbital debris.

Block time is long, block size is maximized, and transaction operations are limited (no smart contracts are present). A native token is used here, and a wrapper on Ethereum mainnet for it should hold and indicate its value.
